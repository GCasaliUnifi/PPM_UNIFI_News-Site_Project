# PPM_UNIFI_News-Site_Project
This is a project assigned by professor Andrea Ferracani for a course I am currently attending at my university.
The professor requested us students to try and re-create various websites using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The website that I had to re-create was
a bay area news website called "The Mercury News" (https://www.mercurynews.com). If you want to check my version of this website go to
https://elaboratoppmcasali.altervista.org .

Some of the logos and icons used are owned by the MediaNews Group (https://www.medianewsgroup.com)
and The Mercury News (https://www.mercurynews.com) and I do not claim ownership of any of them.
